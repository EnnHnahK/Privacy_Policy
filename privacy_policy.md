- Charge you different prices or rates for the App, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties,

## How to Exercise My Rights 📝

If you wish to use any of the rights described below, you may contact us at any time by emailing us at [info@enk.games](mailto:ennhnahk.work@gmail.com).

### Mandatory Verification 🔍

We will need to verify your identity before processing your request. However, because you cannot create an account with the App, and you do not provide us with any information directly, we only collect information automatically, we may use limited verification methods. 

To verify your identity, we will generally require the matching data in our systems to the information we can process when you are making a request. In certain circumstances, we may decline the request, mainly where we are unable to verify your identity, for example, if you disable cookies, change the device you used to access the App, or if you already requested us to delete your personal data.
